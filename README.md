# Emotion Recognition with TensorFlow and OpenCV

## Overview

This project aims to recognize human emotions using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The emotion recognition model was trained on a dataset containing seven human emotions. The primary libraries used in this project are TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of a curated collection of images representing seven human emotions. Images were preprocessed to ensure consistent data quality.

## Training

- **Library Used:** TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Training Time:** Approximately 2 hours
- **Epochs:** 30
- **Steps per Epoch:** 600
- **Batch Size:** 64

During training, a total of 40,145 images were used from various internet sources and datasets. The model achieved a training accuracy of 64% and a testing accuracy of 60%.

## Usage

To use the emotion recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/albpy/Emotion-detection
    ```
Scripts
1. 

1. To train your data
   
    ```bash
    python em1.py
    ```
    
2. Run and display the emotion recognition script:

    ```bash
    python detect_casc.py
    ```

## Results

- **Training Accuracy:** 64%
- **Testing Accuracy:** 60%
